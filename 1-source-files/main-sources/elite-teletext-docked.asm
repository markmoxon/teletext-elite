\       Name: PlotSixelIfEmpty
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Teletext Elite
\    Summary: Plot a mode 7 sixel, but only if the character block containing
\             the sixel is empty
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   X                   Sixel x-coordinate
\
\   Y                   Sixel y-coordinate
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Returns:
\
\   Z flag              Did we plot the sixel?
\
\                         * Clear if we did not plot the sixel because there is
\                           already something there or the sixel is off-screen
\
\                         * Set if we did plot the sixel
